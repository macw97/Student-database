# Student-database
The theme of project was to create a student database.
It has been constructed with the use of base classes, which contain detailed data for that student such as information about particular subjects, semesters and personal data. 
Storage of information was done by using text files. 
The application enables adding new students, reading information and removing selected individual from the database.
